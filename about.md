title: About Me
---

Hi, I’m Kyli! I’m an aspiring data scientist. My goal here is to document my learning, skill building, and job search journey. I graduated from the University of Arizona with a B.S. in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science. I have worked in academic neuroscience research for the past three years. After being laid off, I’m ready to find my niche within the field of data science and develop relationships with other professionals, students, and enthusiasts with a passion for information and data. My interests include natural language processing and predictive modeling. My hobbies include running, traveling, hiking, learning languages, and learning to play instruments, among other things. I hope to incorporate those interests into my future projects! Over the next few weeks I’ll replace the other fields of this web page that are currently occupied by template text. Check back soon!
